                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>My dad's educational journey is a testament to his perseverance and dedication. He began his academic pursuit at SMK Mukah, where he laid the foundation for his education during his primary school years. After completing primary school, he continued his studies at SMK Three Rivers, where he faced numerous challenges but never wavered in his commitment to learning. His determination saw him through high school and into Form 6, where he further honed his skills and knowledge. With a clear goal in mind, he then proceeded to IPG Kampus Batu Lintang, an institution renowned for its teacher training programs. There, he immersed himself in the study of Bahasa Melayu, dedicating himself fully to his coursework and graduating with flying colors in 1994. Shortly after, in 1995, he began his teaching career at SMK Dalat. Over the years, he has become a pillar of the school community, sharing his wealth of knowledge and experience, and continuing to inspire and educate countless students with the same passion and dedication that characterized his own educational journey.</p>
